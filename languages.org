#+title: Languages to be covered

This document contains information about the most widely spoken
languages in India.  This information is used to decide what languages
to include in the translation process.

The translation process involves both computing and human resources.
Translation costs and efforts are measured per language, as both
computational resources and human validators are engages for equal
amounts of time for translation into each target language.  Hence,
deciding the languages to include in the list of target languages is
an important factor for greater impact of the project.

Until a better / more informative source is discovered, the data
collected from the 15th National census survey conducted by the Census
Organization of India in 2011 will be considered as the source of
information for selecting the languages.

* Translation feasibility

Technical feasibility of translation of labs into each of the above
languages is listed below.

|--------+-----------+--------------|
| S. No. | Language  | Translatable |

Other factors like accuracy of translation, usability of translated
labs, availability of human validators etc also needs to be
considered.
