#+title: Lab Translation: Proof of Concept

* Objective

  It was agreed that the existing content may be made available in
  multilingual options or state-specific languages. IIIT Hyderabad has
  kindly agreed to recast one lab as a pilot in two language viz Hindi
  and Telugu in addition to English as default language.


* Motivation

  The *Virtual Labs* portal provides remote-access to Labs for
  engineering students to perform experiments and learn various
  concepts.  However, currently these labs are available only in English
  language, whereas a majority of Indian engineering students are more
  fluent in their native languages as compared to English.  This makes
  it more difficult for the students to focus on learning the concepts
  as they spend more time understanding the language itself.
  
  The =Virtual Labs Translation= initiative aims to address this gap and
  improve the accessibility of Virtual Labs content by translating the
  labs from English to various Indian languages.  This phase of the
  translation project includes translation to =Hindi= and =Telugu=
  languages.


* Experiment Translation

An experiment consists of three types of content: html, images and
javascript code.  Entities of each type contain some text which need
to translated separately.

So, experiment translation involves the following three steps:

1. Text Translation
2. Image Translation
3. Text-in-code Translation


** Text Translation
  
  Translation of a lab (text content) to any given language involves
  the following steps:
  1. Pre-processing: Extraction of text from HTML
  2. Translation
  3. Post-processing: Build HTML files with translated text
     
*** Pre-processing: Extraction of text from HTML

   The lab content is in HTML format.  It contains text, simulation
   and images.  This step deals only with the textual content.

   The text content is extracted from each HTML document, and placed
   in a corresponding =txt= file.  This =txt= file is used in the text
   translation step to get the English text to be translated for each
   HTML document.

   *Effort*: Negligible.  Performed by a script.

*** Translation

   Text Translation is a two step process:
   1. Machine Translation
   2. Human Validation
      
*** Machine Translation
    
    English language text is sent to the translation API, which
    returns the text translated in the target language.  This process
    takes a few seconds for each experiment, per target language.
    Next, the translated documents need to be validated by language
    experts (humans).

    *Effort*: Negligible.  Performed by a script.

*** Human Validation (Text)

    A language expert reads all the translated documents and fixes any
    errors and inconsistencies in the translated text.

    The text content is now ready to be placed in the HTML documents.

    *Effort*: 2 person-day /experiment /language

*** Post-processing: Build HTML files with translated text

**** Build HTML
    
    The text content in HTML documents is replaced with corresponding
    text in the target language using the =txt= file that contains
    mapping from English text to translated text.

    *Effort*: Negligible.  Performed by a script.

    This is followed by a validation step.

**** Human Validation (HTML)

    The HTML documents now contain text a new language.  Even though
    the text has been validated in a previous step, another validation
    is required at this stage to assess the overall quality of the
    translated web-page.

    *Effort*: 0.5 person-days /experiment /language


** Image Translation

   Translating images implies rebuilding each image by replacing all
   the text content in the image with the same text translated in the
   target language.  Here we assume that the images are in =bitmap file
   formats= and the source files (in =vector format= or =container
   format= are not available).

*** Manual Translation
    
    The translation is performed by a language expert using Adobe
    Photoshop for extracting and replacing text in the image and
    google translate for the text translation.
    
    *Effort* : 2 person-days /experiment /language
    
*** Automated Translation 

   Images are translated using [[https://www.imagetranslate.com/][ImageTranslate]] - a tool that performs
   text extraction, translation and rebuilding itself and gives a
   translated image in the target language.
   
   Limited human intervention is involved in validation and editing of
   the results.
   
   *Effort*: 0.5 person-days /experiment /language

      
** Text-in-code translation
  
  Every lab consists of some dynamic content that is managed by
  JavaScript.  This is mostly true for the experiment simulations and
  may include other sections such as quizzes.

  The text content in JavaScript files can be translated in two ways:
  1. Manually searching through the code and extracting all the text
     strings.
  2. Automated extraction.  This is only possible if certain =i18n=
     conventions are followed during the development process.

  *Effort*:
  - 1st Method: 0.5 person-day /experiment /language
  - 2nd method: Negligible

** Types of Models

*** Model 1: With Human Validation

    This option entails translation of Virtual Labs experiments by
    machine translation APIs (Google API, Bing API) followed by
    extensive validation by language experts. The images and
    text-in-code (simulations) are also translated by developers using
    machine translation APIs and language experts.

    The quality and comprehensibility of the content in this model is
    very high.  The cost and effort involved in translation is
    substantially high.  

    The effort required to keep the translated text in sync with the
    changing source experiment (English) is also high. It may require
    the same amount of effort as translating a new experiment.

*** Model 2 : Without Human Validation
    
     This option entails translation of Virtual Labs experiments by
     machine translation APIs (Google API).  In this model the machine
     translated content is not validated by any language expert.  The
     images and text-in-code (simulations) are also translated by
     developers using machine translation APIs.

     The quality and comprehensibility of the content is substantiably
     lesser than [[Model 1: With Human Validation][Model 1]].  However, translation using this model takes
     lesser time, effort and cost as compared to [[Model 1: With Human Validation][Model 1]].

*** Model 3: Google Translate Plugin

     This option entails translation of Virtual Labs experiments by the
     users of Virtual Labs by installing a Google Translation Plugin in
     their browsers. This plugin enables real-time automated
     translation of text content on the web page.  This plugin will
     translate the text content visible in the user's browser.  Text
     content in images and simulations will not be translated.

     Although this model does not require any effort or incur any cost
     for the Virtual Labs team, it does not guarantee predictable user
     experience and the validity of the translated content.

     User awareness on translation plugins is a mandatory requirement
     for this model.

**** Model Details

     Users of Virtual Labs will need to install a plugin based on the
     browser that they use on their system.

     Plugins for some of the commonly used browsers are tabled as
     below.

     | Firefox           | [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/google-translator-for-firefox/?src=search][Google Translator for Firefox]] |
     | Internet Explorer | [[https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/toolbar/ie/index.html][Google Toolbar]]                |
     | Opera             | [[https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/google-translate/][Google Translate]]              |

     |-------------------+-------------------------------|

     These plugins support translation of the text content visible in
     the user's browser.  Text content in images and simulations is not
     translated.

     The user will need to click on the plugin installed and select
     the target language.  This action will translate the content
     visible on the web-page to the selected target language.  This
     process might take a few seconds depending on the internet
     bandwidth.

     The user will need to repeat this process everytime he/she visits
     a new Virtual Labs web-page.
